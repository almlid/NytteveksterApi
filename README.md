# Nyttevekster API

**Nyttevekster** is a Norwegian term that means "plants that can be used for food or as raw materials." This API provides comprehensive information about useful things found in nature.

Often, what some might consider as mere weeds are actually valuable plants that can be employed for various purposes, including food, dye, and even medicine. This project aims to make it easier to understand and use nature, and foster a greater appreciation for the resources nature offers us.

The Nyttevekster API is part of a bigger project born from a deep-rooted fascination with the diverse fungi, flora and fauna found around us. The complete project consists of this API along with a frontend.

## Project Vision

While the current entities and their relations are relatively straightforward, the API already offers data on essential identifiers such as names and seasonal availability. The future roadmap for the API includes:

- Expanding the information to describe what each plant can be used for.
- Providing guidance on plant identification.
- Offering insights into where specific plants can be found.

## Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- SQLite
- Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation
